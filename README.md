## Testing our Network's accuracy

 1. Upload the included ipynb file (`project02.ipynb`) into Google Colab.
 2. Upload the `model.zip` file into the Colab environment.
 3. Find "User uploaded file" (*Load the best model we found -> See if it can make a correct prediction -> User uplaoded file*) in the Table of Contents, select the top-most cell in this section and  choose *Runtime->Run before*.
 4. Run the selected cell.
 5. Upload a 300x300 image file containing a horse or a human.
 6. Run the following three cells.
 7. The output of the last cell represents our network's classification of the uploaded image.
